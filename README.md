# Calculator

This project was created as one of the final projects for the FreeCodeCamp [Frontend Frameworks certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/). It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The following are things I learned over the course of creating this app.

- [Simple redux example](https://codesandbox.io/s/9on71rvnyo?file=/src/components/AddTodo.js:0-774)

# Todo

- [ ] Add mobile breakpoint styling
- [ ] Clear display if user starts entering new number after equals (instead of appending to old number)
- [ ] Add handling for long inputs so display scrolls instead of stretching
