# Calculator

This project was created as one of the final projects for the FreeCodeCamp [Frontend Frameworks certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/). It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The following are things I learned over the course of creating this app.

- [Simple redux example](https://codesandbox.io/s/9on71rvnyo?file=/src/components/AddTodo.js:0-774);

# Todo

- [ ] Make it so that multiple operators in a row defaults to last operator (except for negative)
- [ ] Add styling
